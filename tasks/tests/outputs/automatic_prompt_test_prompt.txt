--- This is a title ---
You can use every macro you want here
Generally you can make a reference to such macros_template with:
#<name_of_file_without_ext>_macros
Make a reference to this template with:
#template_macros
And all the macros you defined here are going to be processed
Lets try it out, I hope you have an example_script.py somewhere
